# Life is short Browser Extension

## 1. What this project is and its purpose
Life is short is a browser extension designed to reduce compulsive time-wasting behavior across social/content platforms.

YouTube is the first implemented module. It tracks how many videos you watch in the active reset window and blocks YouTube after you hit your configured threshold. By default, that window is 8 hours, and it can be changed from the dashboard. The message shown on block is intended as a behavioral nudge: stop scrolling and spend time on higher-value actions.

The project is modular by design so new site modules (for example LinkedIn, Instagram, TikTok, etc.) can be added with separate behaviors and settings as the extension expands beyond YouTube.
